This project is part of BuildSpace's Create-Your-First-Smart-Contract with Solidity curriculum. <br><br>
A two-week course to complete the project and mint and NFT to verify that you've completed the project.
<br><br>
Since I had a basic understanding of JavaScript, it wasn't too difficult to follow along, however I did run into some problems with my working version of node that needed to be rolled back to a previous version. <br><br> I was able to overcome this and deploy the app on the Rinkeby testnet. The project is currently running on Repl.it. <br><br>
This project is a work in progress on which I will be periodically be updating. <br><br>The project created using React and as I progress my knowledge of React, I will be customizing the site and pushing updates. Please stay tuned. 




## Running React on Repl.it


[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
